# db-api Simple Database Abstraction & API

## Purpose

Given the rapidly-changing nature of edge computing, and how databases can be used in and interacted from
the edge, it is important to have a simple, easy-to-use, and easy-to-implement database abstraction layer
to seperate the development of applications from the underlying database implementation.

Additionally, there are different types of API interfaces that can be used to interact with databases, and
certain APIs have strengths and weaknesses in various situations.

This project aims to provide a simple, easy-to-use, and easy-to-implement database abstraction layer that
can be used to develop applications against any number of `x` databases over any number of `y` APIs.
